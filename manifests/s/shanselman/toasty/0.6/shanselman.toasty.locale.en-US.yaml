ShortDescription: A tiny Windows toast notification CLI that knows how to hook into Coding Agents
Description: |-
  Toasty is a lightweight Windows toast notification CLI tool that integrates with AI coding agents.
  It provides desktop notifications when long-running agent tasks complete, with built-in support
  for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and Cursor. Features include automatic
  agent detection, one-click hook installation, push notifications via ntfy.sh, and automatic
  update checking. At just 229 KB with no dependencies, Toasty auto-registers on first run and
  supports both x64 and ARM64 architectures.

ReleaseNotes: |-
  ## What's New in v0.6

  ### 🔔 Push Notifications via ntfy.sh
  Get notified on your phone when AI agents finish! Set TOASTY_NTFY_TOPIC to enable push notifications via ntfy.sh. Supports self-hosted servers via TOASTY_NTFY_SERVER.

  ### 📦 Codex --install Support
  toasty --install codex configures OpenAI Codex CLI to send toast notifications on task completion. Writes the notify array to ~/.codex/config.toml.

  ### 🔄 Version Check & Update Notifications
  Toasty now checks GitHub Releases for updates (once per day, non-blocking). When a newer version is available, you'll see a message in stderr and a clickable toast linking to the download.

  ### 🧪 Test Harness & CI
  - --dry-run flag — outputs what toasty would do without side effects
  - 26 automated tests covering args, presets, XML, install/uninstall, and ntfy
  - GitHub Actions CI runs on every push and PR

  ### 📋 Agent Support Matrix
  README now includes a table showing supported AI agents and their hook/install capabilities.
